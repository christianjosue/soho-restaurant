                    Cooking, the act of using heat to prepare food for consumption. Cooking is as old as civilization
                    itself,
                    and observers have perceived it as both an art and a science. Its history sheds light on the very
                    origins of human settlement, and its variety and traditions reflect unique social, cultural, and
                    environmental influences. The following article traces the evolution of cooking to the advent of
                    national cuisines. See also cuisine; grande cuisine; nouvelle cuisine; molecular gastronomy; culture
                    sections of assorted country articles.
                    Culinary professionals generally cooked quite differently from the women who were cooking only for
                    their
                    families. Baking leavened bread, for example, was largely a professional activity, because ovens
                    were
                    expensive to own and operate.

                    were
                    expensive to own and operate. Much fuel was necessary to heat the earth, clay, or brick interior of
                    an
                    oven, and, once the right temperature was reached, maximum efficiency could be achieved only if many
                    loaves were baked. Most people bought or bartered for their bread.</p>

                <p>Another great bit of advice when it comes to cooking basics is to try simpler recipes for a while and
                    then expand your horizons to the more complex recipes that abound. Most recipes will have a little
                    note
                    about their degree of difficulty and you can read through the recipe to see whether or not it is
                    something you are interested in preparing or confident that you can prepare.

                    The good news is that once you've learned the basics of cooking it is unlikely that you will ever
                    need
                    to relearn them. This means that you can constantly build up and expand your cooking skills.

                A chef is in charge of the kitchen in restaurants or other places where food is served. They watch all
                activity and food preparation with any staff that would assist in the kitchen. They supervise the
                preparation of food for its garnishing and presentation, as well as, the seasonings for a perfect taste.
                A chef orders food or kitchen supplies and provides cost estimates to the employer. They monitor any
                staff
                requirements and production schedules to be sure any services are delivered on time.
